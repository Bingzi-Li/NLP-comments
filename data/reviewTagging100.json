She asked if I'd been to this dennys before because they don't have mushrooms at this dennys, I said yes you do, I always order from this location with Joe and ruby I'm a regular here. She states she's been working here for 7 months and doesn't think they have mushrooms, then she states she cannot find the mushroom add on button. She finally finds it.... I arrive at the restaurant, My food finally comes out after 20 minutes. I always double check my food, there was no egg whites on any of the sandwiches, and no avocado! The girl proceeded to roll her eyes at me and take the food and slam it into the garbage! I asked for a refund when I witnessed her horrible attitude! I worked all day and just finished moving, I don't need attitude from anyone who's helping prepare my food. This person had no idea how to do a CASH REFUND(give the money back duh)she had to call and wake the manager up(there was no manager or supervisor there on duty)from his sleep and he had to walk her through step by step on how to do a refund! Will never go back to this dennys again!! Better training definitely needs to be implemented at this establishment!

I found the perk-cup cafe online and thought it would be great to try a new place for breakfast. The place was pretty empty and we still waited for a seat...it took a long time for our waitress to even make an initial visit. We have two daughters and the one is two years old so things can get hectic at times. Our two year old daughter had peed herself in her pull-up diaper. The seat got wet so I quickly rushed to the bathroom and retrieved paper towels. While I cleaned the seat and placed our daughter on paper towels the waitress finally showed up and asked what we needed for drink. Meanwhile my wife said to save from any further embarrassment we should wait after we place the order to take her to the car to change her. Thinking it should be quick for the waitress to return with our drinks and to take our order we started to get uncomfortable when she took a while. Our thought was that she noticed the accident and was talking about it to the other staff. When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said \"I wouldn't want to sit in that seat after that.\" Instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents, she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident. She was more consigned about the chair than offering to assist with this embarrassing moment. The mess was cleaned off of the vinyl chair and I had placed paper towels until my wife went to the car for another pull-up diaper. I then asked for the manager and she was also the owner, at first she sided with the waitress. After hearing my side she said that she will talk to the waitress about the incident. My wife and I took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama. We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living, after seeing so many infractions on this visit, it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again. After reading other negative  postings and one about their two year old child that had to sit on his father's lap for breakfast due to lack of service, obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant. What a let down. We did however went to another restaurant in downtown Olmsted falls, the waitress was delighted to assist our family! She was very polite and gave attention to our kids! What a difference it was and we were generous with the a 40% gratuity tip. We are people that usually give compliments to assure good service and it takes a lot for us to give negative feedback. Please reconsider this place if you are looking for breakfast as a family with kids. Business need to realize that all the customer wants is good service and to be understood when needing assistance. I really hope the staff and owner gets training in customer
