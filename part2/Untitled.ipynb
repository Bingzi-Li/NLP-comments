      "The best pizza I've tasted, the bartenders are super knowledgeable ask them for the perfect beer from their huge selection to pair with your pizza. \n",

      "My friends and I went there for dinner a week or so ago and we loved it. The portions aren't huge, but it was really yummy. I had the pasta with bolognaise sauce. Very yummy, but a little too heavy for me that day. Lots of meat in the sauce. I'm not sure how the pizza is, but it looked amazing from what I saw. Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She even pronounces the names of the pastas correctly! We had some deserts and they were delish! They have a dish with canoli cream and pieces of the shell to dip in it....mmm that was amazing! We also had their zeppolis...which I have to say were just ok. We're Italian and from NY so compared to home they were small and not as good, but I'll give them effort for trying!\n",

      "Had a wonderful dinner with my out of town work team here on 8/22. Atmosphere was charming, food was great (pizza and salads). Relaxed and fun experience. Everyone enjoyed themselves and left full. Realized today (a week later) I forgot to pick up the detailed receipt for dinner and the amazing staff was able to pull it up for me and text me a photo. I'll be back when I'm in town again. Great dinner and customer service. Thank you!\n",

      "My co-workers and I stopped in here for lunch on a busy Friday afternoon. The lunch special is a good value, and the restaurant smells amazing, but the pizza wasn't my favorite. The dough was very thick and chewy. We were a rather large party, so I understood why our wait time was a little long, but our waitress gave us drinks once and then was never seen again. Just an \"eh, ok\" experience for me.\n",

      "The best brick oven pizza in the area! Pasta was delicious and the atmosphere is great! We needed a restaurant like this in Mooresville!! Upscale yet casual with great food. We had 2 different pasta dishes and a brick oven pizza. We were very pleased with everything we ate and are looking forward to our next visit. This will be my new \"go to\" restaurant!\n",

      "This was our 2nd time at Novanta. We enjoyed the food, the lasagne and the spaghetti squash dish. Both were great. We brought our 3 year olds who enjoyed the pizza dough they got to play with compliments of Lucy.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "The Staff was super friendly and helpful. Nicest people!  The food had potential but needed some tweaking:  meatball appetizers were very tasty but were served slightly cool (I would have enjoyed them better if they were served hot). The pizza margherita was delightful. Flavors melded beautifully.  Crust was light and chewy. I dipped my crust into my meatball sauce. The salciccia e friarelli pagnotello (wood fired sandwich with sausage, broccoli rabe and cheese) was unique. I enjoyed the broccoli rabe, it added some tartness to mellow out the richness of the cheese. They don't have pasta on the lunch menu but they will let you order it off the dinner menu. Just ask your server.  The pappardelle bolognese was slightly disappointing. The pappardelle was cooked perfectly but the bolognese was bland. It needed some additional seasoning.  Overall a very pleasant experience. I would go back.\n",

      "Pizzas are wood fired & personal size - I ate 1/2 there and took the other half home. I got the chicken pesto with grape tomatoes it was good. I probably would get another one next time. Prices are a tad high at $16+ for a pizza for this size (picture shown) \n",

      "Overpriced, inadequate seating, which consisted of a long curved bench with small and uncomfortable metal chairs on the other side offering little privacy from your neighbor, inexperienced staff (no silverware at table, had to ask for it to be brought out both for our salad and for our entree after it was served). Also the Caesar salad we ordered came as an uncut slab from a whole head of lettuce. Not sure where this is traditional but nobody wants to put in work to eat a salad. Highly unrecommended.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I would highly recommend this place. Great food, service and decor and a certain pride that the management and staff have in the restaurant. Using all authentic Italian ingredients their pizza is very similar to the wildly popular Alino's. The pastas and sauces are amazing and flavorful. The lasagna is unusual in its presentation but possibly the best you will ever have. Desserts are great.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I have been going here since it opened and I have never been disappointed in any way. The pizza is terrific with an excellent variety of unique flavors from the wood fired ovens.

      "Soooo good! Started off with a beer flight, followed by Rustica salad so flavorful then the main attraction a pizza perfection \"Sicialiana\" baked in authentic made in Italy wood fired ovens- 90 seconds to bake this masterpiece of light airy crust, nicely charred and again such flavors that meld together. Heaven and to top off our Valentine's Day dinner we had their dessert trio special of 3 mini desserts: tiramisu bread pudding (made in house), blood orange gelato and cannoli in a unique deconstructed style- delicious a great finale. We sat at the pizza bar to watch the ovens but seating was plentiful and varied from counter seating like us to pub style seating on high top tables, bar seating and of course cozy more initiate tables and booths. Our entire meal was $42 without tip and both of us were stuffed. We will be back! Loved it\n",

      "Ok so....I've been here a good amount of times. I will say the pasta is great. Pizza...I think could be better. Very flavorless crust which is a bummer. Tonight I went with a friend...our waitress was decent. I will say one BIG thing I dislike about this place...no bread!!! What kind of real Italian place doesn't give you bread?? Kinda cheap to skimp our on...So we asked our waitress for some and she looked at us like we had ten heads, then says I guess I can bring you a \"loaf\", and comes back with the smallest bread loaf I've ever seen. Literally for two people.....it was maybe the size of an English muffin all together. (Look at picture. Picture looks big but it wasn't bigger than half my hand balled up) Then she had the nerve to charge us a dollar for it!!! Oh, and it was burnt. Tasted like pure charcoal. Really ridiculous. And honestly, the pasta I got was overpriced considering there was no meat.\n",

      "Have now been to Novanta twice. Like the menu, the pizza's are good but still not above Alino's . The appys are good and the pasta dishes are substantial except for the lasagna, which seemed to be more about presentation than anything. The main reason for the 3 star rating was the service. Both times we have been there i get the impression they are one server short. Having to wait 10-15 minutes for someone to approach us for drinks etc is to long, period!\n",

      "/n\n",
      "Good food, it's a laid  back atmosphere and the wait staff was great. A little pricey. The menu was a little confusing on the sliders appetizer. We ordered them and the menu said $8 but we were charged $15. Menu should be more clear it states 4 meat sliders for $8 but supposedly that means 4 different types of meat?? So if you are going to offer 2 sliders for $8 or 4 sliders for $15...you need to have both prices on the menu based on how many sliders you get or have the waitress explain it. It wasn't explained before we ordered and no exception was made after the fact. A little misleading.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "We loved the new pizzeria and glad they came to our community.  They have developed a nice atmosphere except that the lighting is a little too bright.  It would be a great place to watch the games on the weekends if they add a few TVs.\n",

      "Holy hell, this place is so good. I sat at the bar and Trevor asssisted me. Started off with the sangria (which is made fresh) this is well made and smooth. I had the candied pecan salad to start, so tasty and fresh. Then I had the margarita pizza, hot and well balanced for flavor. This place rocks for food and drinks.\n",

Loved the peppers.  The hostess also advised me they make their own mozzarella each week. You could see the difference in the pizza. Would love to go back and try more.\n",

Located in Langtree, they have an open concept, with a combination of standard tables and long tables for family style seating, as well as seating at the pizza and pasta bars.  We chose to sit at the pizza bar so we could watch the chefs in action.\n",

      "We started with the Fritti appetizer.  Yes, it's all fried, but wow, was it good!  You get arancini, fried dough, and fried pasta.  I love arancini, but my favorite was the fried pasta.  It's basically meatball-sized pasta, rolled in a coating, and the deep fried.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our entrees, we had the Strizzo \"pasta\" (me), and P & A pizza (my husband).  The Strizzo's pasta is made with zucchini and squash, so the \"noodles\" are slightly crunchy.  The sauce is a super rich cream sauce that is absolutely delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Their pizzas are personal sized, and my husband's P & A (which stands for prosciutto and arugula) was very good.  Pizzas are made to order, and have just the right amount of toppings.  My husband only wished that larger sizes were available.  \n",

      "I just went to Novanta for the second time; this time for lunch.  I updated this review as there are a lot of negative reviews on here. I feel like people need a proper perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is by no means a traditional pizza place, nor is it what most people would call a traditional brick oven pizza place. If that's what you're looking for, well this place is not for you. This place is a traditional Neopolitan wood oven pizzeria and restaurant. The ingredients are fresh and authentic as is the menu. If you go to say a Moroccan restaurant and you've never had true Moroccan food before, you're not going to be upset (or at least you shouldn't be) because it was not what you expected. The quality of the ingredients and the freshness is what dictates the price. This place is upscale casual and it's prices are on point with that. I don't know or have any affiliation with the owners. I am writing this as this is a new restaurant that I happen to enjoy. This new restaurant is doing something unfamiliar to a lot of people in the area. If this restaurant was in NYC it would be getting great reviews, because in NYC people are familiar with the Neopolitan concept. The local community should give any restaurant a fair shot instead of bombarding it 1 star reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay below is my actual review of the restaurant.\n",

      "Was looking for a new place to try in the Lake Norman area for a rather large party for a birthday dinner.  Called around to several places, with no luck for reservations since it was Valentine's weekend.  Novanta gladly accepted our large party and so glad they did!  I have to say I was a little concerned over the menu not having a large selection of items, and many of the people in our party being picky eaters, but when the food came out, everyone was happy!  The toppings on the pizza are high quality, and cover just enough of the pizza not to overwhelm the chewy pizza crust and delicate tomato sauce.  We also tried the lasagna, which had layers of flavor (especially in the bottom of the dish!).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside was our waiter was apparently in the weeds, and with a large party, was unable to keep up with refiling of beverages and totally forgot the appetizer.  Perhaps putting two servers on a table that large would have been better, especially seeing how busy our waiter was.  Overall, they got our party seated on time and the food came out perfectly, so I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area!!\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I always judge people by their wine and beer menus first, and they totally impressed. Fun and unique wines and tons of local beers. \n",

      "New favorite pizza stop in LKN!\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Hmmm not sure what is 4-5 star worthy but not the meal I ordered. I got the prosciutto, arugula flatbread sandwich thing. It's a cold sandwich. There's no dressing or anything to bring it together and one cherry tomato cut in half stuck randomly in the sandwich is a no go...especially due to it not being fresh. I recommend a vinaigrette and turn it into a panini. The side salad literally had pieces of lettuce with brown edges. Cmon where's the quality and return on investment for the sandwiches. It was $12?!\n",

      "My son and I ordered two cheese pizzas, both of which came with salads. The salads were superb, but the pizza tasted very plain to me, and my son wasn't a fan. This was surprising for both of us because we love sweet and the sauce is very sweet. Additionally, it's the same owners as Brooklyn South, which we love. Just different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is borderline perfect, the place is clean, and the hostess is excellent at her job, so 4 Stars. Palma told me the Chicken Parmesan is incredible. I'll be back to check it out, but at $22, it better come on a gold platter and have my first name written in the cheese. \n",

      "Fun spot. I'm glad I got to come check out this place in Langtree. I wasn't overly impressed with the food, but it is good. I've just been to many brick oven pizza places to compare it too. It's nice that Mooresville has one up in this area. The pizzas are more personal size, so I feel they are a bit pricey for the size (in comparison to Alino's, where you pay $22 for a pizza that is 2-3x the size). The indoor space is very cute and open - love the wooden interior decorations. We also had a calzone, which at the price of $16 is a bit steep (It said $12.00 on the menu, but apparently, they just \"updated prices that day).\" Overall, I think it may be a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I would come back and try some of the pasta dishes, but wouldn't make this my go to spot.\n",

From appetizers  to drink to entrees to desserts you just won't get better service or food than Novanta. The peach desert was a singular highlight of the meal. It is a generous serving size and looks like you'll never be able to finish it after a delicious meal, but it is so light, before long you've eaten the whole desert. The sauce is to die for! We also had tomato marmalade with goat cheese on crisp pieces of bread. I want a whole jar of the marmalade! This was our 2nd meal at Novanta. It is destination eating when we are in the Charlotte area.\n",

      "Best lunch special in LangTree! I came in for a lunch meeting and loved a simple little salad and pizza. It was too much food and well worth the price tag ($11) for the amount of food I received. I took half of the pizza home for an early dinner. \n",

      "Not to mention the Caprese App was so great.\n",

      "Fantastico Italian food! This is the real deal when it comes to Italian food. The owners are fabulous people that make a point to speak to their customers. Staff is awesome. They were willing to help me custom order a dish to my liking.\n",

      "I give Novanta a 4.3, and I would definitely recommend going if you like authentic Napoletan Pizza. If that's the case, it's worth going out of your way to give it a shot. First, the positives, which greatly outweigh the negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house salad that comes on the tray with the pizza is lightly covered in Balsamic Vinaigrette, and the vegetables are fresh. The salad is an easy 10, and probably one of the best salads I've had at any restaurant in my lifetime. The pizza is a 9 for me, but wife gave it a 9-10 (she's not very specific at times). My son also loved the pizza, which is amazing because he usually backs off when a lot of sauce is visible The atmosphere is excellent. Very clean and comfortable. The service was superb (friendly and attentive). \n",
      "\n",
      "The only negatives are minor. The biggest one is that the chairs are not comfortable. They're tiny. If you want more comfort, sit on the couch side. Another minor negative is that the Gelato doesn't taste like Gelato and much more like Vanilla Bean ice cream (if you order vanilla). Regardless of what flavor you order, it's going to taste more like ice cream than Gelato. If you want Gelato, go to Alino's (also in Mooresville). \n",
      "\n",
      "Another side note that is neither a positive or a negative is that you will likely be ordering a pizza/salad for each person at $10/clip. This is a good deal for an individual, but it can add up for a family or group because it's not like going to a traditional pizza shop and ordering a pie that several people can share. Just think of it as paying a premium for a more unique experience. \n",

      "Overall, recommended. We will be back.\n",

      "We went with friends tonight to Novanta for dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, the place is absolutely beautiful. I loved the decor, this is truly an upscale restaurant which I am happy about. We need more upscale choices at the lake, we lack them in this area. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started out sharing 3 salads, the Dolce, Rustica and Caesar. The Caesar had a beautiful presentation. The romaine was grilled and crispy with a lightly drizzled caesar dressing (which was some of the best I have had) and shaved pecorino romano. It was served with toasted bread. We all loved it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Rustica had grilled artichokes, mozzerella cheese, roasted peppers, tomatoes and prosciutto. It was more of an italian flavored salad and also enjoyed by all of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Dolce was equally as delicious and tipped the scale for 3/4 of us. We LOVED this dressing as well as the sweet and salty flavors. It was a sweet dressing and on the salad was candied walnuts, tomatoes, purple onion, goat cheese, pancetta and raisins. Can you say YUM??!! \n",
      "\n",
      "We then ordered 2 pizzas with veggie toppings. They were really good pizza's. These pizza's are Neapolitan style which are much different from their other restaurants which offer NY Style. I had only had Neapolitan style pizza a few times prior so don't have much to compare it to but did like this pizza. It was the size of a personal pizza (maybe around 12\") It was a good size for one or 2 people or even for a nice appetizer for the whole table. It's definitely not a \"traditional\" type of pizza (with lots of cheese and heavy sauce), that many of us are used to, but very delicious. I would advise that if you try this place, you don't think you are walking into Brooklyn South because this is a very different style pizza, it's straight out of Italy. This is not NY style pizza so don't think you are ordering this. They nailed it, if you know anything about Neapolitan pizza. I did have to add salt but I salt a lot of things. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also shared 2 pasta dishes with the table. We had the Orechiette and the Strizzo dish. The Orechiette was good but the Strizzo was out of this world. We were all shocked at how good this was. It was zucchini and squash \"pasta\" (it was shaved to look like pasta), with the most incredible tomato cream sauce on it.   We all asked for more and more bread to dunk in the sauce until we finally ordered another one for the table. We all dove in and devoured that plate as well. We couldn't believe it wasn't pasta! It was delicious!!! This is one that I'll be craving and going back for. We call couldn't get enough of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately they don't have desserts until another week or so. We did request to see the menu and were very happy with what we saw. We are looking forward to the cheesecake and the dessert donuts. :)  They sound delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's my review.  I was so excited to try this place as we kept hearing about it. But, I was a bit hesitant based on the reviews they had been getting on Yelp. Nonetheless, we decided to go and check it out. The owners also own other pizzerias in town and before moving out of state a few years ago, we would frequent Brooklyn South on a weekly basis. It was by far our favorite pizzeria. These negative reviews on Yelp, didn't make sense based on the food we have eaten at their other restaurants.  Their quality is superior in their other establishments. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been to many other restaurants when they first open and know that it takes a few weeks to work out the glitches and get things right. I don't get these negative reviews on Yelp, as that was not our experience. The owners even came to check on us (and other tables), and wanted our opinions on how we liked the restaurant, and acted as if they genuinely wanted to know. We actually gave them a few suggestions, like to add a shrimp or chicken (add on) option to our favorite dish. The owner was very open and appreciated the suggestion. I also am a business owner and know the work it takes to open something and get it right. I love my yelp app and value it very much. I use it all the time for restaurant reviews. I think some of these other reviewers have been a bit harsh as this place hasn't even been opened for 2 weeks.  (IMHO)\n",
      "/n\n",
      "The atmosphere is super cool and cozy. I love that you can watch them prepare all the food. Good selection of craft beers. Wood pizza is great as is the toasted Caesar salad. My kid loved the lemon sorbet (sorbet in a real lemon). My only complaint (and I'm reaching here) are the icky paper napkins.  We will be back!\n",
      "/n\n",
      "This is the best pizza I have ever tasted. It is different from the typical Italian New York or Chicago pizza you know. The folks are the most friendly I have met. Order the Sushi.\n",

      "Fabulous pizza, desserts, coffee!  Fresh mozzarella makes the pizza delicious. If you are craving Italian, give this a try. Staff friendly and prompt.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "The pizza is a traditional Napoletan Pizza which I have never tasted in Italy but heard that it is supposed to be softer and slightly higher than the traditional Italian pizzas -- thin and crispy. I have recently traveled to Europe and had opportunity to taste it there. I went in for lunch today and I can say this meets what the restaurant is presenting. It is authentic as it gets! \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I like the pizza to be thin and crispy but I am not saying this pizza was bad at all, it was great for what style it is and truly lives by its name - Neapolitan pizza!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be back for the pasta, from the pictures they look amazing and also there is no garlic used here at all THANK YOU VERY MUCH! All the so called \"italian\" restaurants overload on garlic, that is not Italian cooking at all!\n",
      "\n",
      "To the bad reviewers, specially the vegetarian one... get a grip! If you are vegetarian go eat in a vegetarian place and don't come here complaining about lack of veggie options.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "We go to Novanta at least once a month, and have settled on a few favorite dishes.  Their salads serve as great starters.  While their sizes are shareable, my husband and I usually get our own.  He likes the Dolce e Crostata--with goat cheese, golden raisins, and candied walnuts--while I prefer the grilled Caesar--with deliciously charred romaine, tomatoes, and sliced bread, and homemade dressing.  We also love the arancini, and do often share that when we are not in the mood for a salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, you can't go wrong with their pizza.  It's one of our top favorites in the CLT area, as it's cooked in a wood-fired oven, and is perfectly crispy on the outside - no soggy crust here!  I like their pastas, with their lasagna being truly exceptional, having fresh layers of pasta, mozzarella, and meat sauce, all made to order.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have room for dessert, I highly recommend the deconstructed cannoli.  It's homemade, and divine.  Their gelato is well thought-out, served with a side of espresso to soften the ice cream and add a unique flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Presentation is very careful and well-thought out.  Service is always good as well.  The gentlemen at the pizza bar are especially friendly, and fun to talk to.  \n",

      "We love this place, and will keep it on our \"short list\" for nearby dining!\n",
      "/n\n",
      "So I was in the area last week for Thanksgiving and had heard that an authentic wood fired pizzeria had recently opened so had to check it out.  Well it did not disappoint!  Coming from NYC I'm used to having top notch pizza options back home and this place knocked them out!  Pizza was amazing and loved local brew options. Can't wait to be back in the area!\n",
      "/n\n",
      "The food is outstanding. Traditional Italian pizza is well done. Some of the portions are a little small but the quality makes up for it. Service left a little to be desired but it is a new restaurant and that will be worked out.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Tired Novanta for the first time and will be back.  The door was warm and inviting.  The wood decor and open kitchen was very nice.  We started off with the Antipasto Plate and then Pizzas.  Everything was fresh and delicious.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I have eaten here twice now and held back reviewing it until after my second visit. The pizza is ok. It's not great-not horrible. Just average. You can tell the ingredients used are mediocre. The crust is good but with the pizza being so small the amount of crust leaves very little room for the other \"stuff\". I have had 4 different pies and all the same - somewhat bland in flavor, and a small amount of food for the money. If they would just make the pies a more reasonable size and improve the sauce, cheese and toppings used they might be onto something cause the place had a nice atmosphere. I also tried one of the pasta dishes and it was also ok. Nothing here was bad, but also nothing I would really want to go back for again. Overall very average quality, nice atmosphere and very expensive for what you get.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Sorry. Wanted to like it but no. Not much to the pizza except the crust, and it was burnt. Even if the pizza had had a more appropriate portion of sauce, toppings to crust I still would have missed the pepperoni.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "The food was good, but they don't give you much at all.  If you want to charge a lot you should provide enough food.  I left the restaurant after lunch and was still hungry and had about 22$ less cash in my wallet.  I did enjoy the food, so I'll give them 3 stars.  But if they want to be long term they must provide more food.  Give customers their money's worth!  Also don't go skimpy on the toppings.  I got like two basil leaves on my margarita pizza.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Was here first week they opened and ordered the pizza. Pretty bad...then started coming back to give them a second chance and had the pastas and appetizers, salads and they were good. Decided to give the pizza another chance... awful. No taste. Cheese had no taste, very dry and very burnt on the edges after saying we didn't want it burnt. Very disappointed to have to pay for a lousy meal.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I stopped in for dessert as I was told there was a pastry chef on staff. The peaches n cream was horrible and a waste of calories. Not say it was $10.00 which is way over priced for dessert.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Pizza is good... Pasta is ok... But the bill will be pricey!\n",
      "I've tried this place twice.. And it's just an ok option! I think there is better Italian in the LKN area, and j believe the pizza is beat by another similar establishment. I think the owners are killing it with Brooklyn south, but I'm not sure they are killing it with Novanta\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Hey! What is happening at Novanta?  This has always been at the top of my list - until last Tuesday.  The food has always been awesome - not anymore.  I ordered the zuccini pasta which came to me with 95 percent carrots.  My husband ordered a pasta dish that was overcooked and gummy.  Such a disappointment!  We did notice that none of the owners were present and it looked as though the kitchen was being run by a group of kids.\n",
      "Don't let this restaurant go down - it is worth keeping alive - before it's too late.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Appetizers were good, Served with a nice presentation.  However to charge $2.50 soda fountain water is absolutely uncalled for.  It's table water.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Really wanted to love this place as I live near LangTree.  Pizza was okay but not nearly big enough for the price.  Without apps, one pizza wouldn't be enough for me.  The toppings stop about 3/4 way through the pie so it ends up being a lot of crust on top of the small size.  Hopefully they make some changes as the price is prohibitive for what you get.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Tonight my wife and I decided to try out Novanta we were looking for something new in the area that is not a chain. So she suggested we try out Novanta saying she was pretty sure they were owned by the same owners as Brooklyn Boys Pizza in Mooresville. Which we both like and I can say with moderate certainty its close to New York Pizza. The space is dark and rustic and very comfortable and is very nicely decorated. The Whole Restaurant is done in reclaimed Brick and Wood from a warehouse in the Bowery in NY, simple and beautiful in design but enough on that. We decided to eat at the bar which was really nice because the Bar faces the windows so you looking out at the Christmas tree in Langtree and not at a wall of bottles. We were told that during the summer the windows  open and they will probably have stools outside so you can be at the bar but be outside.\n",
      "Our bartender Amber was very attentive and gave us the run down of the menu and the what beers were on tap. My wife went for a glass of Pinot grigio and I decided on the AssClown Winter release. Decided to order appetizers and a pizza to share to get a good review of the menu. So I had the Antipasto sushi I don't remember if that is the exact name but it was very good it was mozzarella which they make in house, basil and some meat I was so hungry I don't remember what It was. my wife had the antipasto for two which was a nice assortment of cheese and meats. The ricotta is made in house and it came with prosciutto and salami,olives. Food came out hot and fresh and it was awesome. Wood fired pizza comes out with a little char it's not burnt in the least so don't listen to other reviews when they say it's burnt. If they think that is burnt they should,d definitely not try coal oven pizza, like frank Pepes in CT. We met one of the staff Mitch because he curiously was wearing a hard hat around the restaurant. Well after seeing that we had to ask why,come to find out it's because he is pretty tall and has nearly knocked himself on several occasions. So good food and nice beer selection friendly staff overall I don't think they are going out of business any time soon with that formula. So I would take some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt especially anyone with only one or two reviews. This is definitely a new destination for dinner out I highly recommend it take the negatives again with a grain of salt I don't know why everyone has to be such an *^%#% when reviewing somewhere new.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Been here twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner.  Service has always been good. For lunch I had a sandwich and salad. Both were very good.  Went for dinner to have pizza. Ordered the A&P and a kids cheese. I understand the wood fire gives it a char but both pizzas were just plane burnt!!! Crust and bottom. Could not taste anything but burnt crust. Son only ate a few bites of his. Seems like it may be a little to hot in the oven. Dough was still raw on the inside.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "This is our second visit..,. first one wasn't good but we decided to give it another try......just AWFUL....that is putting it mildly.....salad was good but pizza was disgusting.....there was a scant amount of sauce that had NO flavor.....the cheese was  cheap tasting and DRY.....the pizza was BURNED to the point where I was pulling it apart trying to find a morsel that wasn't blackened to a crisp......we complained and the waitress said \"oh it looks like you are eating it!\"... seriously? We came in and we were famished and was hoping for a decent meal.....wow!!!! Just gross....never will I come back again.....a pretty place  but the WORST food!!!!!!!! I'm actually angry that I have to pay for this!!! I'm leaving pissed and hungry.  Alinos is sooooo much better, tastier and really good....\n",

      "I'm very familiar with pizza in the style of Naples Italy.  I've eaten at many of Naples Italy's best pizzerias.  There are plenty of places in the states offering well executed versions of traditional Pizza Napoletana.  Novonta is not one of them.  The dough is too dense and doesn't have the proper flavor development.  The tomatoes were good, but dried out.  The handmade mozz was flavorless and I didn't like the way it looked when it melted.  Like burnt marshmallows.\n",
      "I tried a few different pizzas and found fault with all of them.  On a pizza with Arugula and Prosciutto, we were served a dried out prosciutto that had been sliced too thick.  Another pizza with spicy salami and hot peppers had a decent flavor, but there wasn't enough salami.  Their basic Margherita was too dense, dry, and lacking flavor.\n",
      "The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful.  Just a bunch of visually appealing textures and surfaces.  With all there is to look at in the space, you'll never be wishing there was a t.v. to stare at.  This is a new place, so maybe they'll dedicate more time to improving the pizza.  As is, I wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I had been to Novanta once before for lunch and decided to try again with my daughter as she wanted pizza and I was in the mood for pasta. Checking the menu on line I had preselected Pappardelle Bolognese, which is described as having a four meat sauce with house made ricotta cheese and pappardelle pasta. Yummy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival we were sat immediately and greeted by our waiter. We ordered waters as I requested a little time to look at their Italian wine list, most by the glass or bottle. My 5 year old daughter got a basic kids cheese pizza, I ordered the pasta and asked if I got a bottle could they cork it so I could take the remainder home as the price per glass was rather high compared to the bottle-typical. He said of course and ran off as I yelled a request for bread for my starving baby girl. The wine -a $28 Chianti I never heard of was delivered by out waiter who rather ceremoniously set it on the table while trying to crack a joke stating; \"it's a screw top so it makes it easy to take home\" and walked away. No open and pour, no check to be sure I liked it, nada. A few minutes later the food and our bread was delivered simultaneously. My daughter's pizza was not at all like I recalled my first visit. My first experience was a tasty Neapolitan style pizza, my daughter's slightly smaller scale version was slightly charred on the perimeter and under cooked in the middle at the same time. Seems hard to do for an 8\" pizza. My pasta to put it lightly was a huge disappointment.  The \"meats\" were hard to taste albeit find, and the meal itself really lacked much memorable flavor to warrant even a rating of 1 or 2.  However, I have to say  the overall service was so pour it was easy to give the experience a 1. In fact if it was possible to rank it minus I would do so for the $55+ \"experience\" of food and wine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note to owners. Your other Brooklyn pizza places are great. Living in Cornelius we visit your Brooklyn South location and it's great. Please read this review to your staff as soon as possible. My recommendation-train your staff to property serve a bottle of wine. I didn't order a Diet Coke. Your four pasta choices need to be either upgraded or eliminated or ask the chef to at least retool the one I had. It needs a lot more of the four \"meats\" to live up to the description of Bolognese. Don't serve cut up pizza dough as \"bread\"- why bother? Honestly tonight  I could have gotten better food, better service and a better overall experience at less money at your other Brooklyn South location not to mention competitors like Brixx down the street in Birkdale.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "Meh...This is Neapolitan style pizza, which is probably healthier than the usual American style, but is much less satisfying. It is so thin that it is too messy to eat by hand. Yet, some toppings can't easily be cut with a knife and fork. For example, the main ingredients of the prosciutto and arugula pizza are layered on after the pizza is removed from the oven, not actually cooked with the pizza. This is not only hard to eat, but also means the flavors don't really mesh. Lastly, the place is pricey and service was a bit slow. If you love Neapolitan pizza, you might like this place. If not, you might want to skip it.\n",
      "/n\n",
      "I had high hopes for this place, I was referred by a friend. I was quite disappointed by how small the pizzas were at $16 each- we needed four pizzas just for our family of 4.  And all four pizzas had too much sauce and not enough cheese. All the pizzas needed salt or other seasoning, they had no flavor.\n",
      "My other issue was with ventilation. I hate walking into a restaurant and you can smell strong cooking odors. I felt like this place smelled very heavy of almost burning wood fire, so when I leave my hair reaks and i need a shower (ladies you know what i mean!)\n",
      "My husband made a comment that people probably go there once to try it but then usually don't go back again. I agree.\n",

      "We stopped in to Novanta at the beginning of their second week.  I'm rooting for all of the businesses in Langtree at the Lake at exit 31 to be raving successes so I use my discretionary money to do my part to support them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped in at about 6:30 pm and the restaurant was already bustling.  The three of us were seated within 5 minutes in the middle of the restaurant.  Decor is eclectic, the restaurant is very attractive and definitely a place you'd like to linger and hang out in.  The bar area had a number of couples and groups eating and there were many children in the dining area, so people of all stages were here.  I think people are definitely looking for their \"Cheers\" in some manner of speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was extremely pleasant.  She had drinks brought round quickly and we ordered the grilled Caesar salad to start.  To my vast surprise, it was on the table in about three minutes.  The salad was listed as a lightly grilled romaine heart with roasted cherry tomatoes and drizzled with Caesar.  I've long been curious about grilled romaine and just never got around to doing it myself.  This romaine simply kissed the grill for a nano-second so I was a little disappointed in the \"grilled\" portion of the dish.  The Caesar dressing was delicious and the grilled bread was out-of-this-world delicious, I'd suggest the restaurant make that a stand-alone appetizer suggestion or pair it with a dip of some sort.  The blanched and peeled tomatoes had a slightly odd mouth-feel to me, I'm not a super fan of peeled tomatoes outside of sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "We finished our salad and our entrees came out promptly right behind it.  I ordered the Capricossa pizza which comes with a red sauce, mushrooms, artichokes and Italian ham.  The style of pizza served at this restaurant comes from a wood fired grill which cooks the pizzas very fast, in about 90 seconds.  The crust is chewy and crunchy in some places and blackened in others.  This is the nature of this style of pizza.  (think about it, there's NY style, Chicago deep dish style, Buffalo NY style, thin crust style...).  Personally, I like this style of pizza.  But. I don't think Americans are fond of their pizza being 40-45% crust.  I am getting the impression that that is one of the reasons for the discontent with the pizza here.  The relatively expensive $16 cost for this pizza-for-one that was 45% crust and just slightly too charred for me did affect my star rating.  This is a really expensive pizza.  And there simply won't be leftovers.  It's too small to share, plan on ordering one per person.  The man at the table next to me was upset about his pizza and I heard him ask for more ham (which they brought out) and he spread it across his naked crust.  My best advice to the restaurant is to respect the expectations of the consumer and if the pizzas are going to stay this price, make 'em less crusty and more topping-y.  And cut them into 6 slices instead of 4, it' just makes for easier eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese which is a wide cut noodle with a four meat tomato sauce.  $14 for a serving that is exactly right for one person with no leftovers.  He enjoyed it.  Our third person ordered the Orechiette which came with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe.  This was $16 and again, right size for a meal, no leftovers.  The reason I keep making this distinction is because this makes this place an expensive night out. $16 and $14 a plate for pizza and pasta.  I'm paying for the overhead I know, the lovely restaurant, the expensive wood fired ovens, the likely extravagant rent, but here's the rub... 1 salad, 1 pizza, 2 pastas, 3 beverages cost me $80 and I was out of the restaurant in 30 minutes.  Were I in a hurry to go to a movie or watch a game I'd be thrilled, but I was out enjoying my night and dropped $80 in less than half an hour.  I just didn't feel like I'd gotten $80 worth of enjoyment for my 30 minutes and I didn't get leftovers for the next day.   Stores and restaurants don't always understand that if you charge a lot I'll come once, or maybe twice.  If you charge less I'll come often.  And in the long run, often is going to pay your bills.  Because I want Langtree to succeed.  I want a close-by delicious, comfortable, ambiance place that I can pop in to frequently to get dinner or have a GNO or meet another couple for drinks.  This place could be that, but at the current pricing it can't be, is my opinion.  If you charge less, people will come more often and you'll make more money in the long run. Lovely restaurant though and there was a long wait for tables when we left.\n",

It is very good but don't be going in expecting to get a slice of New York style pizza.  The staff was very friendly and one of the owners came up to the table to talk to us about our meal. They have just been open for a couple weeks and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. If I any complaints I would say the food is a bit pricey but definitely well worth it.\n",

We tried 2 kinds...all meat and one with ham, artichokes, etc. there wasn't much of anything on either. I stumbled onto two very thin slices of ham and just hits of mushroom and artichoke.  The two pizzas tasted the alike. Two pizzas, no drinks or salads $35! Not worth it in my opinion.\n",
